# WebScraping

In this project I scraped data from Amazon using BeautifulSoup and Requests in order to track the price of Tolkien's The History of Middle-earth book set (although the product of interest can be virtually anything).


The script runs daily to collect data and store it in a database, which allows to identify trends and patterns in pricing over time.
